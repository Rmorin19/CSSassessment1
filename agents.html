      <p id="p1" tabindex="1">
        There are 4 different types of valorant agents which are Duelist,
        initiator, controller, and sentinel. Duelists are agents that are
        self-sufficent agents that are used to be aggressive and can hopefully
        get an opening pick. Initiators are used to challenge corners, get
        information, and push the other team away. Controllers are used to slice
        up the map for ease of rotation, as well as the ability to blind and
        stun the enemy. Sentinels are used to be defensive and can lock down
        areas.

        With 5 initiators and Fade as the newest, they are Sova, Breach, Skay,
        KAY/O, and Fade. Sova and Fade's abilities aire more on the side of
        getting the positions of the oposing players while Sky and KAY/O are
        based on getting the genral area of them, and Breach is made to deter
        and stun the enemys. Sky and Fade have a similar ability were they spawn
        a player seeking thing blinds and stuns the player it hits. There will
        normally only be one initiator used in a team but other than duelists
        they are the only other type of agents that teams use two of.

        are all very different yet have the same purpose. Sage can heal herself
        and her team and has a wall of ice that can be used to block paths and
        get to tricky spots. Cypher has tripwires and a camera that he uses to
        pin point the enemy. Chamber has the ability to teloport and pull out a
        pew pew that is very much like the sheriff. Kill Joy has a turret and a
        little robot that makes the opposing team vulnerable.
