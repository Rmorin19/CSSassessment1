        <p>
          There are 7 maps in Valorant that are based off of real places such as
          Santa Fe, Tokyo, and Venice. They all have different advantages for
          each type and induvidual character. They are all based in the near
          future where there has been a meteor with rock that gave people
          special powers.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Ascent</h1>
        <img src="pictures/Ascent.webp" alt="" class="maps2" id="relative" />
        <p class="p1">
          Ascent is placed in Venice Italy in the near future which is also
          where the practice range is located. Its 2 sites are played very
          differently from each other. One gives the defenders the high ground
          and has a lower room under the defenders side which is used quick
          frequently to help the other team hide and have shelter from the
          defenders. The second site gives the defenders the low ground and the
          attacker the advantage.

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Bind</h1>
        <img
          src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQc8NuYjBHk2ymaPb5UvTDMqRwxIaNUu2J0sQ&usqp=CAUs1OhZBZu031lDZqTNRQ7CvWVwuULmpc1FCyCTcpfWULmpQ9FDyCfWUheoM1LRQrJDcprPTDTYpgKz60hemkUhWgVH/2Q=="
          alt=""
          class="maps"
        />
        <p>
          Bind is based in Morocco and has teloporters that brind you from one
          site to mid and one site to the other. The first site has high ground
          for the deffenders and the other site gives the other side the high
          ground. It is a very open map that favours long range pew pews and
          agents like Chamber and Brimstone.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Breeze</h1>
        <img src="pictures/Breeze.webp" alt="" class="maps2" />
        <p>
          Breeze is an island in the Bermuda Triangle with ancient ruins. The
          map looks like a beach. The first site has 2 big pyramids in the
          middle and the other team has a cave while the deffenders use the
          ruins. The second site gives both teams the ruins and it has a big
          pylon in the middle.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Fracture</h1>
        <img src="pictures/Fracture.jpg" alt="" class="maps" />
        <p>
          Fracture is where a sience expirament went wrong and kill all the
          scientist who where working there. This map has ziplines that let you
          get from one side to the other. The deffenders spawn point is in th
          middle of the map and has the other team spawning on eather side of
          them. One site is like a fortified base where as the other has a
          little roof you can go on to get high ground.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Haven</h1>
        <img src="pictures/Haven2.png" alt="" class="maps2" />
        <p>
          Haven is the only map with 3 sites. It is based in Bhutan. it has a
          very tradition chinese style and many cherry blossoms. The fist site
          gives the defenders the high ground and the other team the very low
          ground. The second site has many boxes and gives the other team a way
          to flank the defenders. The 3rd site has a lond hallway that gives the
          defenders the advantage but does pose more of a threat that they will
          get flanked.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Icebox</h1>
        <img src="pictures/IceBox.jfif" alt="" class="maps" />
        <p>
          Ice Box is based on an island it the northen Russian sea. It is a
          shiping dock and the first site is base around them. The 2nd one is
          the place where they process the shipments. It favours the mid ranged
          pew pews and agents like Omen and Jett.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div>
        <h1 class="animation1">Split</h1>
        <img src="pictures/Split.jfif" alt="" class="maps2" />
        <p>
          Split is located in Tokyo, Japan and has a modern but overgrown look.
          Its two sites both offer high ground for the deffenders but it is very
          easy to counter with the other teams very good access to mid which
          allows for an easy flank.
